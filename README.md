TurtleVoyage
Welcome to TurtleVoyage, a collection of my first projects using the Turtle graphics library in Python. This repository showcases different graphical projects I've created as an introduction to Turtle graphics.

Projects Included
Polygon Patterns: A project that draws colorful polygons with varying numbers of sides.
Rotating Circles: A visual pattern of rotating colorful circles.
Simple Calculator: A basic calculator created as part of learning Python.
About Turtle Graphics
Turtle graphics is a popular way to introduce programming to kids and beginners. It provides a visual and interactive way to learn programming concepts by controlling a "turtle" to draw shapes and patterns on the screen.
